# Arduino_IR_Radar
IR space mapping with arduino
This project includes radar screen with visualisation of the Data from Sharp Infrared Range Finder.
The client for radar application is written in C# and the source is included in IR-radar-client folder. 
The servo motor (28BYJ-48) is used here in order to rotate the sensor from left to right
  then right to left and for every degree of movement take a series of readings and send them to the serial port.
